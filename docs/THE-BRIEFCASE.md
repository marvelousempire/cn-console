## Overview

**The Briefcase** is the comprehensive system that contains all applications, frameworks, tools, handbooks, and contributions. Inside The Briefcase exists an **Operating System called "Contribution Network"** (CN) that orchestrates and manages all contributions.

The Briefcase is the complete ecosystem containing:
- All Consoles
- All Cartridges
- All Apps
- All Pages
- All Components
- All Handbooks

- Everything in TheBriefcase.App

### Contribution Network (CN) Operating System
Inside The Briefcase, the **Contribution Network** operates as the core Operating System that:
- Manages the registry of all contributions
- Coordinates federated associations
- Provides routing and network configuration
- Enables discovery and integration of contributions
- Maintains the source of truth for all metadata

2. **Framework** - The engine + shared services
3. **Console** - Dashboard UI surfaces (like CN Console)
4. **Cartridge** - Plug-in feature bundles
5. **App** - Modules inside cartridges
6. **Page** - Individual pages within apps
