# ⚠️ DEPRECATED — CN Console

> **This repo is DEPRECATED.** The main version is now in **[ContributionNetwork/console/](https://github.com/marvelousempire/ContributionNetwork/tree/main/console)**.

---

## What Happened?

We merged CN Console into the main Contribution Network repository to keep everything in one place.

**New location:** `ContributionNetwork/console/`

## Where to Go Now

| Need | Go Here |
|------|---------|
| Latest CN Console code | [ContributionNetwork/console/](https://github.com/marvelousempire/ContributionNetwork/tree/main/console) |
| Report issues | [ContributionNetwork Issues](https://github.com/marvelousempire/ContributionNetwork/issues) |
| Full documentation | [ContributionNetwork README](https://github.com/marvelousempire/ContributionNetwork) |

## Why the Change?

1. **One place for everything** — CN Console is the heart of Contribution Network, so it belongs in that repo
2. **Easier updates** — No more syncing between two repos
3. **Less confusion** — One source of truth instead of two

## Migration Guide

If you were using this repo:

```bash
# Clone the main repo instead
git clone https://github.com/marvelousempire/ContributionNetwork.git

# CN Console is at:
cd ContributionNetwork/console/
```

**This repo will remain for historical reference but will NOT receive updates.**

**In Good Faith With Clean Hands**
